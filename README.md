# Pong Remastered
This program represents the software that is necessary to run the remastered version of Pong. This remastered version allows one to play against a simple artificial intelligence that will attempt to defeat the player.

## Implementation
This software was implemented using Javascript and the code.org editor. This program also keeps track of a database to determine the number of times that the user has won versus the number of times that the artificial intelligence has won. This program utilizes basic animation techniques in order to ensure that the game can be played.

## Prerequisites
Because this program was developed using code.org's game engine, it can only be played on the website code.org.
